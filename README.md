# LinearAlgebra
This repository contains a few notes written as small supplement to the first-year undergraduate course "Linear Algebra" at Aarhus University.

The first note contains a small catalogue of common errors I have seen grading handins, why they are errors and how to avoid them.

The second note is a high level overview of linear algebra as a whole with the purpose of giving the reader intuition and a sense of overview.

Both are incomplete and will (hopefully) be extended in the future.
